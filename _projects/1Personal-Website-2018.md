<!-- # The Idea


For as long as I can remember, I have always loved two things: **creating** and **technology**. The technology side I get from my dad, who has been putting me in front of a computer and showing me the importance and power of technology my entire life. The creating side I get from my mom, who lives to create  activities and games for the preschoolers she teaches; always choosing to make something herself than to use someone else's.

It has been a long goal of mine to combine these passions, whether it be with graphic design or animation, however making a website has always been on my mind since it allows me not only have complete control over what I want on it, but also is easily accessible to show off to other people. The idea of having this virtual sandbox which is limited to only my imagination is tempting at first, but with the fact that you can see this sandbox on practically any device that can reach the internet makes the idea enamoring.

#### Task: I wanted to create a website with my portfolio, my contact/social media information, and possibly a blog-type section. In addition, as an aspiring UX designer, I did **not** want it to look amateurish.



# The Plan

For the past few years, I have been on-and-off learning basic(extremely basic) coding languages such as html and css just for fun, but it wasn't until the fall of 2017 that I decided to double down on making a website for myself. I knew that I wanted to make it "by hand"(or as much as possible) and not use something like [Weebly](https://www.weebly.com) or [Wix](https://www.wix.com/) or even [Squarespace](https://www.squarespace.com).

After finishing the entire process of making a website, I realized that making a website is a lot like making any kind of craft item, for this example lets just relate it to a **go-cart**. First, you figure out what kind of features you want your go-cart to have, such as a steering wheel, a spoiler, headlights, or even rad decals. This is also when you figure out what kind of materials you will need. Next you blueprint your go-cart and sketch where each component will go, the size of each component, etc. After that you start to build it, and although you are going off your blueprint, its entirely possible to take some creative liberties and adjustments during the build process. Once you finished it, you test it to make sure it works and fix any errors that come up.

Every part of that process is used in making a website.

When designing the website I would later build, I knew that I wanted it to have a couple of basic characteristics:

-**Simple**. Simple content, simple colors, etc. I wanted it to be straight to the point.

-**Responsive**. I wanted it to scale smoothly so it would look great on any device.

-**Unique**. I wanted it to have a distinct look that differed from a Bootstrap/Squarespace template(nothing wrong with either of them, I just wanted to challenge myself).

So with these ideas in mind I designed a mock up for the website. It was then I thought of keeping a simple system of content on one side, navigation on the other. The content side would be surrounded by a minimalistic round border

Next I decided that since I was already familiar with [Github](https://github.com/) and was interested in the idea of a static site site generator, I would use [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) as my CMS(basically the chassis of the website).

Here's some Jekyll tutorials I watched to get familiar with it:

[DevTips Jekyll Tutorial Series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJhhLvW-Xvg&list=PLqGj3iMvMa4KeBN2krBtcO3U90_7SOl-A)

Lastly, I think its important to mention that this wasn't my first attempt at making a personal website. Honestly I think it's **attempt #8**, my first attempt being 2+ years ago. And although those projects never took flight, I did learn a lot from each one of them.

# The Build

After having the design for the website finalized(which I will end up changing anyway), I started building it with [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/). Bootstrap html/css was the only form of coding which I could say I had experience with prior to building this website, so it was easy for me to jump into building the framework of the website.

This was the first project which I prioritized responsiveness over all else when coding. I realized that no matter how professional or interesting a website might look, if it doesn't scale then it will make the whole thing seem amateur.

Although I was comfortable with Bootstrap, this was my first time using Jekyll. As a result, I changed the backend of the website many times over the course of making this website. For example, after experimenting with Jekyll's default "posts" system for the Projects and Notes sections, I learned about Jekyll collections which I adopted instead.

One of my favorite parts of the website is the SVG logo animation that plays when the website first loads. Having used After Effects for over five years, it was also the most fun to make. After many different versions I have currently settled with a smooth and simple asperand(although it will definitely change in the future). After making the animation, I relied entirely on [Bodymovin/Lottie](https://github.com/airbnb/lottie-web) to  turn the animation into an SVG animation.

# The Publishing

Theres not much detail in how I published this, however it was my first time doing this so I thought I would include it.

I bought the domain from [Google Domains](https://domains.google/) and it is hosted for free on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/). Although I love Github, I might eventually invest in a more private hosting service since all of the files of the website are available for anyone to see.

As for the future of the website, I'll continue to adjust and tweak it from time to time until I scrap it for a new website(for whatever reason). I look forward to seeing what kind of improvements I can make in the future.
